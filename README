Libiscsi is a clientside library to implement the iSCSI protocol
that can be used to access resource of an iSCSI Target.

The library is fully async with regards to iscsi commands and scsi
tasks, but a sync layer is also provided for ease of use for simpler
applications.


The src directory contain a handful of useful iscsi utilities
such as logging in to and enumerating all targets on a portal
and all devices of a target.

The examples directory contain example implementation of how to
access both the sync and acync api of libiscsi.



Libiscsi is a work in progress.
It aims to become a full async library for iscsi functionality,
including all features required to establish and maintain a iscsi
session, as well as a low level scsi library to create scsi cdb's
and parse/unmarshall data-in structures.


Installation
============
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

Build RPM
=========
To build RPMs run the following script from the libiscsi root directory
./packaging/RPM/makerpms.sh

iSCSI URL Format
================
iSCSI devices are specified by a URL format on the following form :
    iscsi://[<username>[%<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/<target-iqn>/<lun>
Example:
    iscsi://server/iqn.ronnie.test/1
When using CHAP authentication, username and password can be specified as part of the URL
    iscsi://ronnie%password@server/iqn.ronnie.test/1
but this may make the user and password visible in log files as well as in ps aux output.
So it is also possible to provide either just the password or both the password and username
via environment variables.
The username and/or password can be set via
LIBISCSI_CHAP_USERNAME=ronnie
LIBISCSI_CHAP_PASSWORD=password

Example:
   LIBISCSI_CHAP_PASSWORD=password iscsi-inq iscsi://ronnie@10.1.1.27/iqn.ronnie.test/1
