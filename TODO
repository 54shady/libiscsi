Some features that should be added

* Target driven iscsi-nop, to teach the library to respond to these.
  These are unsolicited nops sent from the targetr which we need to respond
  to. TGTD does not suppot these but IET should do so and could be used
  to test with.
  This is a simple addition, but needs a target that uses iscsi-nop
  for testing.
  Since libiscsi will be a responder to these commands, we will
  not receive a reply to these, as we do for almost all normal commands.
  This is somewhat similar to how we do data-out pdus. 
  See ISCSI_PDU_DELETE_WHEN_SENT and iscsi_send_data_out() for how
  create and send PDUs to which we will not expect a response.

* More efficient api for read/write commands where we read/write straight
  from the socket into the buffer the application specified instead of as now
  we pass the data to a callback and then copy it.

* More scsi marshalling and unmarshalling functions in scsi-lowlevel

* Autoconnect for session faiulures.
  When the tcp session fail,   try several times to reconnect and relogin.
  If successful re-issue any commands that were in flight.

* Redirects

* Integrate with other relevant utilities such as 
  dvdrecord,
  ...

* Data Digest
